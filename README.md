# pippo-code

I think it's important to keep problem-solving skills alive, I pay special attention to solve coding exercises regularly during my free time.
The repository contains my solutions to several programming problems, each solution is implemented in Java and encapsulated in a class.
I provided comments and aimed to keep code clean and readable and always find an efficient solution in terms of computational time and memory space.
This repository also serves as a learning resource for me and for anyone who is interested in understanding different ways to solve coding problems.
